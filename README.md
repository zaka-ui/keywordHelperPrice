# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Getting Started

To start the app, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Before running the app, you need to install the project dependencies.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
This will install all the necessary dependencies, including React, Vite, and other required packages.

2. Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the app with the following command:

bash
    npm run dev
    This will start the development server, and your app will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is already in use).

3. Build for Production (Optional)
If you want to build the app for production, run:

bash
npm run build
This will create an optimized build of your app in the dist/ directory.

4. Preview Production Build (Optional)
To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

bash
    npm run preview
    This will serve your production build at http://localhost:5000 by default.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during setup or running the app, try the following:

Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, download it from here.
If you see errors related to missing packages, try running npm install again to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
Check the Vite documentation for additional troubleshooting tips: Vite Docs.
